Please write a query to return a list of all product groups that are available in the US but have not sold any units.
Expected output columns: product_group
*/

Answer added as follows:
To solve this problem, we need to find product groups that are available in the US (i.e., marketplace_id = 1 from the CATALOG table) but have not sold any units (i.e., items in ORDERS do not match).

Query Explanation:
Find US Product Groups:

Filter the CATALOG table for marketplace_id = 1.
Select all product_group values available in the US.
Find Sold Product Groups:

Join the ORDERS table with the CATALOG table on item and marketplace_id.
Only include items that have sales (units > 0) in the ORDERS table.
Exclude Sold Product Groups:

Use a LEFT JOIN or a NOT IN subquery to exclude product groups that appear in the sold list.
Remove Duplicates:

Use DISTINCT to ensure no repeated product groups in the output.


SQL Query as follows:
SELECT DISTINCT c.product_group
FROM CATALOG c
WHERE c.marketplace_id = 1 -- Only include US product groups
  AND c.product_group IS NOT NULL -- Exclude null product groups
  AND c.product_group NOT IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT c2.product_group
      FROM CATALOG c2
      JOIN ORDERS o
        ON c2.item = o.item
       AND c2.marketplace_id = o.marketplace_id
      WHERE c2.marketplace_id = 1 -- US only
        AND o.units > 0 -- Only items with sales
  );

Query Walkthrough:
The inner query:

SELECT DISTINCT c2.product_group
FROM CATALOG c2
JOIN ORDERS o
  ON c2.item = o.item
 AND c2.marketplace_id = o.marketplace_id
WHERE c2.marketplace_id = 1 -- US only
  AND o.units > 0 -- Only items with sales
Finds all product groups that have sold at least one unit in the US.



The outer query:
SELECT DISTINCT c.product_group
FROM CATALOG c
WHERE c.marketplace_id = 1
  AND c.product_group IS NOT NULL
  AND c.product_group NOT IN (subquery above);
Filters out product groups that have been sold and keeps the unsold ones.
Expected Output (Based on Sample Data)
From CATALOG (US only, marketplace_id = 1):

item	product_group
A22	books
C13	games
H59	books
Q30	games
P12	toys

From ORDERS (Sold items in the US with units > 0):
item	product_group
A22	books
C13	games
Q30	games
P12	toys

Unsold Product Groups:
product_group
books

Explanation: The only unsold product group is "books", as the item H59 from books in CATALOG has no sales in the ORDERS table.

Final Output:
product_group
books
